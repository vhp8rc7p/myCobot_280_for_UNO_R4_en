**Dexterous Hand:** Used when gripping objects

**Introduction**

- The gripper is a robot component that can achieve functions similar to human hands. It has the advantages of a complex structure, firm gripping of objects, not easy to drop, and easy operation. The gripper kit includes gripper accessories and LEGO technology parts. The end effector of the robot arm is controlled by a programmable system to achieve functions such as object gripping and multi-point positioning.

**Working principle**
- Driven by a motor, the gripper's finger surface makes linear reciprocating motion to achieve opening or closing. The acceleration and deceleration of the electric gripper can be controlled, the impact on the workpiece can be minimized, the positioning point can be controlled, and the clamping can be controlled

**Applicable objects**

- Small cubes

- Small balls

- Long objects

## Gripper installation:
Insert the Lego connector into the gripper hole:

## Python programming control

+ AR Version

```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
import time

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 1000000)

mc.set_encoder(7,2048,40)#Open
time.sleep(2)
mc.set_encoder(7,2300,40)#Hold
time.sleep(2)
mc.set_encoder(7,2048,40)#Hold
```
+ Pi version
```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
from pymycobot import PI_PORT, PI_BAUD # When using the Raspberry Pi version of mycobot, you can reference these two variables to initialize MyCobot280
import time

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
mc = MyCobot280(PI_PORT, PI_BAUD)
mc.set_encoder(7,2048,40)#Open
time.sleep(2)
mc.set_encoder(7,2300,40)#Hold tight
time.sleep(2)
mc.set_encoder(7,2048,40)#Hold tight
```
