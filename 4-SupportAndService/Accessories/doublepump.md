**Suction pump**: Used for adsorbing objects

**Introduction**

- Suction pump, that is, vacuum adsorption pump, has two suction nozzles and two exhaust nozzles for one inlet and one outlet. It is more stable than single-head suction pump. It has the advantages of simple structure, small size, easy use, low noise, and good self-priming ability. By controlling the suction pump kit as the end effector of the robot arm, the function of adsorbing objects is performed.

- Suction pump accessories: power cord x1, DuPont line x10, one-input and two-output connection line x1, Lego technology parts x several

**Working principle**

- When sucking objects: the air pump starts to suck air and adsorb objects and then stops, and there will be no leakage in a short time.
- When putting down the object: the electronic valve starts, the air release valve opens, and air enters the vacuum suction cup to separate from the sucked object.

**Applicable objects**

- Paper/plastic sheets
- Flat and smooth objects
- Cards, etc.

**Installation and use**

- Check whether the accessories package is complete: Lego connectors, Dupont wires, double-head suction pump

- Double-head suction pump installation:

Structural installation:

Insert the Lego connector into the reserved socket on the suction pump:
![](../../resource\4-SupportAndService\Accessories\pump/BP3.jpg)

Align the suction pump with the connector plugged in with the socket at the end of the robotic arm and insert it:

- Electrical connection:

Select the male-female DuPont wire, and insert the female end into the socket marked with pins on the suction pump box:

Note the correspondence between the DuPont wire colors and pins in the figure:

Insert the male end into the robot base pin according to the given correspondence:

> The left side is the suction pump pin, and the right side is the robot arm pin
> GND -> GND
> 5V -> 5V
> G2 -> 23
> G5 -> 33

## Programming development:

> The code is as follows:

- 280-AR version:

```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
import time

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
arm = MyCobot280('COM3', 115200) # The baud rate is 115200 by default, and some boards are 1000000, please modify it according to the actual situation

# Turn on the pump
def pump_on():
    arm.set_digital_output(33, 0)
    time.sleep(0.05)

# Stop the pump
def pump_off():
    arm.set_digital_output(33, 1)
    time.sleep(0.05)
    arm.set_digital_output(23, 0)
    time.sleep(1)
    arm.set_digital_output(23, 1)
    time.sleep(0.05)

for i in range(2):
    pump_on()
    time.sleep(2)
    pump_off()
    time.sleep(2)
```

- 280-Pi version:

```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
from pymycobot import PI_PORT, PI_BAUD # When using the Raspberry Pi version of mycobot, you can reference these two variables to initialize MyCobot280
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
mc = MyCobot280(PI_PORT, PI_BAUD)

# Initialization
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
# Pins 20/21 control the solenoid valve and the exhaust valve respectively
GPIO.setup(20, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)

# Turn on the suction pump
def pump_on():
# Open the solenoid valve
GPIO.output(20,0)

# Stop the suction pump
def pump_off():
# Close the solenoid valve
GPIO.output(20,1)
time.sleep(0.05)
# Open the vent valve
GPIO.output(21,0)
time.sleep(1)
GPIO.output(21,1)
time.sleep(0.05)

pump_off()
time.sleep(3)
pump_on()
time.sleep(3)
pump_off()
time.sleep(3)

GPIO.cleanup() # Release the pin channel
```

Save the file and close it, return to the command line terminal, and enter:

```bash
python pump_double.py
```

> You can see that the suction pump opens after 3 seconds and closes after working for 3 seconds
