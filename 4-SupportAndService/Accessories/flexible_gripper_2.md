**Flexible gripper:** Used to grip objects

**Introduction**

- Traditional industrial suction cups need to suck the flat surface of the material. In more and more working conditions, the suction surface is easy to damage the panel or components. The soft-touch gripper grabs the edge and easily transports the panel without marks or damage, ensuring that the product surface is flawless and improving the yield rate.
- The modular design of the soft-touch gripper is light in weight and can be freely arranged and combined according to the size of the panel.
- The clamping force of traditional cylinders is generally large, and the force is difficult to control. The edge of the clamped panel is easy to be clamped and warped. The single-finger clamping force of the flexible gripper is precisely controllable and will not clamp fragile workpieces.

**Working Principle**

- The flexible gripper is an innovative bionic flexible gripper developed by researchers imitating the shape of the arms and legs of a starfish. The "fingers" of the soft gripper are made of flexible polymer silicone material, which can bend and deform by inflation. It can adaptively wrap around the target object like a starfish, and can complete the flexible and non-destructive grasping of irregular and fragile objects.

**Applicable objects**

- Any object of any shape within a reasonable size

**Installation and use**

- Check whether the accessories package is complete: Lego connector, gripper with connecting wire, extension wire

- Gripper installation:

Structural installation: Insert the Lego connector into the reserved socket of the gripper. You can choose two different directions for installation as needed:

## Programming development

- AR version:

```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
import time

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 115200) # The baud rate is 115200 by default, and some boards are 1000000, please modify it according to the actual situation

# The following three methods can control the gripper to open-close-open
# Method 1:
mc.set_gripper_state(0, 80) 
time.sleep(3) 
mc.set_gripper_state(1, 80) 
time.sleep(3) 
mc.set_gripper_state(0, 80) 
time.sleep(3) 
# Method 2: 
# mc.set_gripper_value(100, 80) 
# time.sleep(3) 
# mc.set_gripper_value(0, 80) 
# time.sleep(3) 
# mc. set_gripper_value(100, 80) 
# time.sleep(3) 

# Method three: 
# mc.set_encoder(7, 2048, 20) 
# time.sleep(3) 
# mc.set_encoder(7, 1500, 20) 
# time.sleep(3) 
# mc.set_encoder(7, 2048, 20) 
# time.sleep(3)
```

- Pi version:

```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot280
from pymycobot import PI_PORT, PI_BAUD # When using the Raspberry Pi version of mycobot, you can reference these two variables to initialize MyCobot280
import time

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
mc = MyCobot280(PI_PORT, PI_BAUD)

# The following three methods can control the gripper to open-close-open
# Method 1:
mc.set_gripper_state(0, 80)
time.sleep(3)
mc.set_gripper_state(1, 80)
time.sleep(3)
mc.set_gripper_state(0, 80)
time.sleep(3)
mc.set_gripper_state(0, 80)
time.sleep(3)
# Method 2:
# mc.set_gripper_value(100, 80)
# time.sleep(3)
# mc.set_gripper_value(0, 80)
# time.sleep(3)
# mc.set_gripper_value(100, 80)
# time.sleep(3)

# Method 3:
# mc.set_encoder(7, 2048, 20)
# time.sleep(3)
# mc.set_encoder(7, 1500, 20)
# time.sleep(3)
# mc.set_encoder(7, 2048, 20)
# time.sleep(3)
```

Save the file and close it, return to the command line terminal, and enter:

```bash
python grip.py
```

> You can see the gripper open-close-open
