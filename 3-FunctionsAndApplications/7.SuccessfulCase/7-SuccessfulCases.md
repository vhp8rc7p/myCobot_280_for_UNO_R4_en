# 280 PLC IO Interactive Control Case
## 1. Functional Effect Description
After receiving the IO signal from the PLC, the robot arm will perform an action to return each joint to zero position

## 2. Principle Description
Since the input and output of the robot arm is 3.3V and the input and output of the PLC is 24V, a 5V relay and a 24V relay are required. The output end of the robot arm will first output a signal to energize the 5V relay coil, connect the normally open contacts, and pass the 24V signal to the input end of the PLC. After the PLC collects the input signal, the PLC output end will output a signal to energize the 24V relay coil, connect the normally open contacts, and pass the 3.3V signal to the input end of the robot arm. After the robot arm collects the input signal, it will perform an action of returning each joint to zero position

## 4 Software Programming
Robot Program
```python
import time
mc=MyCobot("COM6")
mc.set_basic_output(5,1)
while 1:
if mc.get_basic_input(2)==1:
mc.sync_send_angles([0,0,0,0,0,0],50)
break
else:
pass
mc.set_basic_output(5,0)
```
