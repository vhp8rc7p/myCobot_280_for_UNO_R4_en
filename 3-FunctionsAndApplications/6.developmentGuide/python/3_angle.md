## Joint Control

For serial multi-joint robots, the control of joint space is to control the variables of each joint of the robot, and the goal is to make each joint of the robot reach the target position at a certain speed.

> **Note:** When setting the angle, the limit of different series of robot arms is different. For details, please refer to the parameter introduction of the corresponding model.

### Example use

```python
from pymycobot.mycobot280 import MyCobot280
import time

# MyCobot280 Class initialization requires two parameters:
# The first is the serial port string, such as:
    # linux: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
    # windows: "COM3"
    # The second is the baud rate:
    # Arduino version: 115200 # The baud rate is 115200 by default, and some boards are 1000000, please modify it according to the actual situation
    # For example:
        # mycobot-Arduino:
            # linux:
            # mc = MyCobot280("/dev/ttyUSB0", 115200)
            # windows:
            # mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 115200)

# Initialize a MyCobot280 object
# Here is the object code for the windows version
mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 115200) # The baud rate is 115200 by default, and some boards are 1000000, please modify it according to the actual situation
time.sleep(2)
# By passing the angle parameter, each joint of the robot arm moves to the corresponding position [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
mc.send_angles([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 50)

# Set the waiting time to ensure that the robot has reached the specified position
time.sleep(2.5)

# Move joint 1 to the position of 90
mc.send_angle(1, 90, 50)

# Set the waiting time to ensure that the robot has reached the specified position
time.sleep(2)

# The following code can make the robot swing left and right
# Set the number of loops
num=5
while num > 0:
    # Move joint 2 to the position of 50
    mc.send_angle(2, 50, 50)

    # Set the waiting time to ensure that the robot has reached the specified position
    time.sleep(1.5)

    # Move joint 2 to the position of -50
    mc.send_angle(2, -50, 50)

    # Set the waiting time to ensure that the robot has reached the specified position
    time.sleep(1.5)

    num -= 1

# Retract the robot arm. You can swing the robot arm manually, and then use the get_angles() function to get the coordinate sequence.
# Use this function to make the robot arm reach the position you want.
mc.send_angles([88.68, -138.51, 155.65, -128.05, -9.93, -15.29], 50)

# Set the waiting time to ensure that the robot arm has reached the specified position
time.sleep(2.5)

# Relax the robot arm and swing it manually
mc.release_all_servos()
