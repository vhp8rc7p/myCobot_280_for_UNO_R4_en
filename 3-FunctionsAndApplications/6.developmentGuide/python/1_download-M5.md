# Environment setup

pymycobot is a Python package for serial communication with myCobot, supporting Python2, Python3.5 and later versions.

Before using pymycobot to control the robot arm, you need to build a Python environment. The following is a detailed description of Python download and installation.

## Download and install Python

**Applicable devices:**

* myCobot 280:
* myCobot 280 Arduino
* myCobot 280 PI
* myCobot 280 Jetson Nano
* myCobot 280 Arduino

Currently, there are two versions of Python, one is `2.x` version and the other is `3.x` version. These two versions are incompatible. As `3.x` version is becoming more and more popular, our tutorial will take the latest `3.10.7` version as an example.

###  Install Python

> **Note: **Before installing, please confirm whether your computer is 64-bit or 32-bit. Right-click `My Computer` and select `Properties`. As shown in the figure below, it is a 64-bit operating system, so select the 64-bit Python installation package.

* **Python official download address: https://www.python.org/downloads/**

* **Click the `Downloads` option to start downloading Python, click `Add Python 3.10 to PATH`, click `Install Now` to start installing Python**

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/pythondownload1.jpg" style="zoom: 33%;" /> 

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/pythoninstall2.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

 <img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/pythoninstall3.jpg" style="zoom : 50%;" /> 

* **The prompt "Setup was successful" appears, indicating that the installation is complete**

* <img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/pythoninstall4.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" /> 


### Run Python
  After successful installation, open the command prompt window (Win+R, enter cmd and press Enter), and type `python`. Two situations will occur.

**Situation 1:**

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/successfulinstallation.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The prompt in the picture indicates that Python has been successfully installed.

The prompt `>>>` indicates that we are already in the Python interactive environment. We can enter any Python code and get the execution result immediately after pressing Enter.

**Case 2:**

If the input is wrong (for example, enter pythonn), an error message will appear:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/installerror.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

> **Note:** The error message is generally caused by not configuring the environment variables. You can refer to **1.3 Configure environment variables** to modify the environment variables.

### Configure environment variables
Since Windows will search for python.exe according to the path set by a Path environment variable, if it is not found, an error will be reported. Therefore, if you miss checking `Add Python 3.10 to PATH` during installation, you need to manually add the path where python.exe is located to Path, or reinstall Python and remember to check the `Add Python 3.10 to PATH` option.

The following are the steps to manually add the path where python.exe is located.

* Right-click My Computer –> Select Properties –> Select Advanced System Settings –> Select Environment Variables in the lower right corner:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/environment configuration.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

* Environment variables mainly include user variables and system variables. The environment variables that need to be set are in these two variables. As shown in the figure below:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/user variable1.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

* User variables are used to download programs that can be used in cmd commands. Write the absolute path of the program to the user variable and you can use it, as shown in the figure below:

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/user variable2.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

* After completing the above steps, open the command prompt window (Win+R, then enter cmd, press Enter), type Python, and the prompt in the figure below indicates success:

### Before use

* Firmware burning. Firmware refers to the device "driver" stored inside the device. Only through firmware can the operating system implement the operation of a specific machine according to the standard device driver. Different versions of the robot arm need to burn different firmware (refer to the **MyStudio**chapter).
* **Arduino version** The Basic at the bottom needs to burn minirobot. After the burning is completed, select the **Transponder** function (this function is used to receive and forward the instructions sent by the Basic at the bottom to perform the target action), click `Press A`, and the **Atom: OK** prompt message appears, which means success. In addition, the latest version of atomMain is burned in the Atom at the end of the Arduino version. It is burned by default at the factory, and there is no need to burn it yourself.
* **Pi \ jetsonnano version** The latest version of atomMain is burned in the Atom at the end. It is burned by default at the factory, and there is no need to burn it yourself.
* pymycobot installation. Open a console terminal (shortcut Win+R, enter cmd to enter the terminal), and enter the following command:

```python
pip install pymycobot --upgrade --user
```

<img src="../../../resource\3-FunctionsAndApplications\6.developmentGuide\python\build/pymycobotinstall.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* Source code installation. Open a console terminal (shortcut Win+R, enter cmd to enter the terminal), enter the following command to install:

```python
git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot.git <your-path>
#Where <your-path> fills in your installation address, if not filled in, the current path is used by default

cd <your-path>/pymycobot
#Enter the pymycobot folder of the download package

#Run one of the following commands according to your python version
# Install
python2 setup.py install
# or
python3 setup.py install
```

## Simple use of Python

After the above preparations are completed, start to control the robot arm through Python code. Here, the MyCobot 280 Arduino version is used as an example for demonstration.

First, open the PyCharm you installed, create a new Python file, enter the following code, and import our library:

```python
from pymycobot.mycobot280 import MyCobot280
```

**Note:**

1. If you enter `from pymycobot.mycobot280 import MyCobot280`, there is no red wavy line under the font, which proves that it has been successfully installed and can be used. If a red wavy line appears, you can refer to [**How ​​to install the API library** ](https://www.cnblogs.com/xiaoguan-bky/p/11184740.html), [**How ​​to call the API library**](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/25648fc1e86917d191fd009d.html).

2. If you do not want to install the API library through the above command, you can download the project to your local computer through the following github.

First, go to the project address: **https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot**. Then click the Code button on the right side of the webpage, and then click Download ZIP to download it locally. Put the pymycobot folder in the compressed package pymycobot file project into your python dependency library directory, and you can directly import and use it.

### Simple Demonstration

Create a new Python file in PyCharm and enter the following code to execute the LED flashing.

> **Note:** The corresponding baud rates of various devices are different. Please refer to the information to understand their baud rates when using them. The serial port number can be viewed through **[Calculator Device Manager](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook/4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/4.1.1-myStudio_download_driverinstalled.html#4113-%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%8C%BA%E5%88%86cp210x%E5%92%8Ccp34x%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87)** or the serial port assistant.

The following are the corresponding codes for myCobot.

* **myCobot**

```python
# demo.py
from pymycobot.mycobot280 import MyCobot280

import time
#The above codes are required to be written, which means importing the project package

# MyCobot280 class initialization requires two parameters:
#   The first is the serial port string, such as:
#       linux:  "/dev/ttyUSB0"
#       windows: "COM3"
#   The second is the baud rate:: 
#       Arduino version is:  115200
#
#    Example:
#       mycobot-Arduino:
#           linux:
#              mc = MyCobot280("/dev/ttyUSB0", 115200)
#           windows:
#              mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 115200)

# Initiate MyCobot280
# Create object code here for windows version
mc = MyCobot280("COM3", 115200) # The baud rate is 115200 by default, and some boards are 1000000, please modify it according to the actual situation
time.sleep(2)

i = 7
#loop 7 times
while i > 0:                            
    mc.set_color(0,0,255) #blue light on
    time.sleep(2)    #wait for 2 seconds                
    mc.set_color(255,0,0) #red light on
    time.sleep(2)    #wait for 2 seconds
    mc.set_color(0,255,0) #green light on
    time.sleep(2)    #wait for 2 seconds
    i -= 1
```

If the following error message appears when executing the code, please check carefully whether the serial port number in the program is correct. You can solve this error message by checking the serial port number of your computer and changing it to the serial port number you found in the program. If the program runs normally but the robot arm does not respond, please check whether the baud rate is entered correctly.
